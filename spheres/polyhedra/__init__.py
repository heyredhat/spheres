        # To distribute points uniformly over a spherical surface, the
        # easiest thing is to invent its location in polar coordinates.
        # Obviously theta (longitude) must be chosen uniformly from
        # [0,2*pi]; phi (latitude) must be chosen in such a way that
        # the probability of falling within any given band of latitudes
        # must be proportional to the total surface area within that
        # band. In other words, the probability _density_ function at
        # any value of phi must be proportional to the circumference of
        # the circle around the sphere at that latitude. This in turn
        # is proportional to the radius out from the sphere at that
        # latitude, i.e. cos(phi). Hence the cumulative probability
        # should be proportional to the integral of that, i.e. sin(phi)
        # - and since we know the cumulative probability needs to be
        # zero at -pi/2 and 1 at +pi/2, this tells us it has to be
        # (1+sin(phi))/2.
        #
        # Given an arbitrary cumulative probability function, we can
        # select a number from the represented probability distribution
        # by taking a uniform number in [0,1] and applying the inverse
        # of the function. In this case, this means we take a number X
        # in [0,1], scale and translate it to obtain 2X-1, and take the
        # inverse sine. Conveniently, asin() does the Right Thing in
        # that it maps [-1,+1] into [-pi/2,pi/2].
