    "We know well how we can view constellations on the 2-sphere as SU(2) representations, in other words, as spin-j states (up to phase). In other words, these states represent the intrinsic angular momentum of a massive particle. On the other hand, massless particles also have a form of intrinsic angular momentum: polarization. Indeed, we've seen how we can use the sphere to represent polarization states: a trick that was known even to Poincare. "

    "Given a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ state quantized along the $Z$ axis, we can obtain the corresponding polarization ellipse simply by rotating the overall phase of the state, and taking the real part of its two components. If we treat these two real numbers as $(x, y)$ coordinates in the plane, they trace out the correct ellipse. In this basis, $Z+$/$Z-$ correspond to horizontal/vertical polarization, $X+$/$X-$ correspond to diagonal/antidiagonal polarization, and $Y+$/$Y-$ correspond to clockwise/counterclockwise circular polarization. Any arbitrary point on the sphere, then, corresponds to some ellipse in the plane. In this case, we'd take the $Y$ axis to coincide with the linear momentum axis of the massless particle, and the polarization state describes how the particle is \"corkscrewing\"/oscillating in the plane orthogonal to its motion. A photon is of course a spin-1 particle, but since it's massless, one of its polarization components ($j=0$) is frozen out, and so it reduces down to a two state system.\n",

Projecting the two points onto this plane, one obtains the two foci of the polarization ellipse. In other words, a spin-1 state specifies an ellipse *oriented in 3D*. (As the paper points out, however, this construction gets the size of ellipse wrong, and they suggest a slight variant as a remedy.) \n",

    "And so, in a sense, we can view a quantum structured Gaussian light beam as being the third quantization of a qubit. We start with a classical spinning object and first quantize it into a qubit. Then we second quantize the qubit to get all the higher representations of SU(2), which correspond to nothing more than *copies* of the original classical phase space, in terms of the 2D quantum harmonic oscillator. But these states also correspond to classical solutions of the paraxial Maxwell's equations for a light beam. And so we quantize a third time, introducing a harmonic oscillator to each of those modes, which count the number of photons in those states, and end up with a fully quantum beam... and then we start wondering if those states correspond to *yet another* other classical system... Ironically, we go from a sphere, to a plane, to a line... Maybe we should look for something 0 dimensional next. "
